After the run of waves in Majanicho, and the swell started to fade, I decided to head back to [Cotillo](https://surfermap.com/item/guide-surf-spot-el-cotillo/), but I had totally misjudged the size of the swell.

When I got there it was big and closing out.

It mostly continued to be oversized the next day.

No one on this.

At one point when it looked manageable and other surfers were out.

I had a go as well, but the waves were too fast to have a good session, even though it looked good sporadically.

**Playa de Esquinzo**

The next morning I decided to drive down and check out [Playa de Esquinzo](https://surfermap.com/item/guide-surf-spot-esquinzo/), which can handle a bit more swell without closing out.

I had very [good memories](https://www.instagram.com/p/1aiRZXza6H/) of the beach from last time I visited Fuerteventura. There were good waves there, but the peak was shifting around the beach, making it very hard to predict where the wave would break.

A few surfers had already been surfing it, and now only a single surfer was out.

He was working to be in position, but the waves were popping up fast and unexpectedly.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5142_resized.JPG)

Nobody was on this one either.

The bay this wave breaks in is awesome. I love this beach, even though getting there is a painful 20 minute dirt road.

**Punta Gorda**

After surfing Esquinzo I decided to drive north and check out [Punta Gorda](https://www.wannasurf.com/spot/Europe/Canary/Fuerte_Ventura/punta_gorda/index.html), which is left-hand reef break I had heard nice things about. The sand road to get there along the coast made me a bit nervous of getting stuck, but everything went fine.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5172_resized.JPG)

When I got there the wave was already breaking nicely and there was no one out.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5188_resized.JPG)

When I got in 3 surfers were out, but after a while, around 20 people where in the water, too many for my taste!

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5181_resized.JPG)

I caught a few nice ones, so it was alright. I would like to have another go with less people around though. :fish:

I had a nice drive along even more sketchy road to spend the night in Majanicho once again.

**North Shore**

The next day in Majanicho a new swell had arrived and I took a walk a little up the coast to the spot known as [Acid Drop](https://www.wannasurf.com/spot/Europe/Canary/Fuerte_Ventura/Acid_Drop/index.html) looking to photograph some big waves.

The wind wasn't perfect and it was mostly messy.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5205_resized.JPG)

A few had paddled out, they were not catching anything and were struggling to not get caught by bigger sets.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5220_resized.JPG)

This spot is one of the go-to spots for the locals when the waves get big. Today is was nearly surfable. A few more people were considering it.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5243_resized.JPG)

The swell increased once again the next day and big waves were breaking all along the north shore, here Majanicho.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5266_resized.JPG)

The wind once again, was keeping surfers out of the water on most other spots.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5295_resized.JPG)

This might aswell have been a shack in the Caribbean.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5279_resized.JPG)

I drove the rest of the North Shore to Corralejo, but didn't see anyone out.

**Cotillo**

I decided to spend the night in the city of Cotillo and found the action I had been looking for there on the reef in the north part of the city.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5298_resized.JPG)

A few surfers were tow surfing huge waves.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5304_resized.JPG)

I only managed to get a few pictures of the surfers before their session was over.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5328_resized.JPG)

A surfer getting barreled on this wave. Unfortunately I had the wrong lens with me for this one.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5340_resized.JPG)

Even after the surfers left, it was a nice spectacle.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5349_resized.JPG)

Lots of people out to watch the waves.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5374_resized.JPG)

The waves this day were the result of storm Dennis.

![](/assets/20200220/IMG_5407_resized.JPG)

Fun to watch and fun to photograph.
