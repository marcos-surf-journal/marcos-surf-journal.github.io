After more than a month on Fuerteventura I finally got to surf [Rocky Point / Bajo del Medio](https://surfermap.com/item/guide-surf-spot-bajo-del-medio/). The wave is a regional classic, but it is located in the middle of Corralejo and I have so far prioritized waves surrounded by nature.

The combination of wind and swell however, made this one of the good spots to surf today. The swell from the storm hitting Europe yesterday, was too powerful for my little home on the cliffs in Cotillo, and Rocky Point is a sheltered spot that starts working well on bigger swells like these.

I woke up next to Las Dunas de Corralejo to the view of the volcanic island of Lobos pictured above. Lobos was one of the other options to surf today, and looking through my binoculars and camera the waves looked to be firing. There were many boats and surfers out there.

After a quick stop at the local swimming pool for a well deserved hot shower, I drove to Rocky point and checked out the surf.

The waves were looking pretty fun despite the amount of people in the water. There was definitely some size on the bigger sets, around 1.5-2 meters, and I saw some surfers catching some long lefts that looked super fun.

One of the local surfers told me that the waves would improve after turning the high tide, which meant I had a little more than an hour to kill so I got my camera and started documenting the beautiful day.

After a while I couldn't wait anymore and wetsuited up. It was great to get in the water again after a few laydays because of bad winds. The session was very good. The waves were even better than what they looked from outside.

There were quite a lot of people in the water, but it was possible to paddle out a little further towards the middle of the bay, where the bigger sets broke. Amazingly we were only 3-4 people there. Surfing the bigger waves was surprisingly easy and fun, because they were breaking very clean.

After catching 3-4 waves the crowd started intensifying a little as even more people came. It was no longer just a couple of us and it got a little more competitive. I decided to call it a session after nearly 2 hours and paddled in.

After changing I took out the camera again for the last photos of the day. This Stand-Up Paddle gang were surfing the wave further inside the bay.

I was trying to get a good photo of a wave with the volcano in the background and caught some dance moves by the surfer with the yellow surfboard. This reef is super pointy and pretty painful to walk on without reef boots.

A few minutes later there was an entire dance group on the reef!

This guy looks like he has done it before.

The waves kept on coming and a lot of people were catching waves before sunset.

I understand why this is such a popular wave. The takeoff is easy and not too steep. That makes the bigger waves much easier to surf compared to the typical beachbreak. I thought that it was a great first session at Rocky Point.

My parking spot for the day. Access to the beach is by the first caravan in the background.
