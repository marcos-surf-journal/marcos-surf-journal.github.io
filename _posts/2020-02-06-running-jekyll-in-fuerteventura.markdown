After 2 months of travelling in my van I found the last bit of motivation to setup a site to document my surf trip.

Thanks to Jakob of [Ruby on Wheels][ruby-on-wheels] for the tip on [Jekyll][jekyll] and for the inspiration to pull up the command line!

Jakob is travelling around Europe in an awesome, converted military Mercedes-Benz 508D truck, while working remotely full-time as a software developer for GitHub. Very cool! Be sure to check out his blog :)

On this site, I hope to capture a little bit of my surf trip and the waves I find a long the way, hopefully also for future trips.

The experience of living in my van next to the surf spots of Fuerteventura and Lanzarote has been incredible so far, and the goal of this site is to share little bits of it here.
