My time on the Canary Islands is coming to an end. 3 months have passed and I can already feel how much I will miss the easy "surf, eat, sleep, repeat" lifestyle here. In a week I will hand over my van to the mechanics of [Karvans](http://www.karvans.com) in Seville to get my engine fixed. Meanwhile I will go home to Copenhagen and anxiously wait for the moment where I can come back and pick it up.

Until then I want to look back the earlier parts of the trip.

**A great start to 2020 in La Pared**

Upon returning to Fuerteventura after spending a lovely Christmas at home with my family, I drove straight to the southern part of the island.

I had been wanting to see this part since first visiting the island years ago. The Forecast was looking great, plenty of waves and offshore winds as long as the forecast could tell, perfect conditions to start the new year.

After doing some research on the way, I decided to check out La Pared - that turned out to be a great decision!

The parking spot was fantastic on a high cliff overlooking the beach.

There was two different surf breaks on the beach. This one would only break on some days. I had one or two sessions on this one.

The main spot was the break further south down the beach.

Day after day the waves were groomed by offshore winds like this.

It was a great place to start. The waves were very fast but fun - and most days I would surf in the morning and afternoon.

Beyond the waves - the beach was beautiful and busy with lots of non-surfers visiting as well.

A nice little one.

I was glad to meet Rober here - who I had already met on the ferry from Huelva. He used to have a T3 for many years until it became too small for his family and they upgraded to the RV infront of mine on the picture below.

Rober and his wife run a little family clothing line called [Barbucias](http://www.barbucias.com) where they sell t-shirts, caps, mugs and more. They describe themselves as a "wanderlust family" and it was inspiring to hear about their passion for enjoying camperlife and nature as a family. I would meet Rober later again on the north coast.

My van on New Years. A quite one this year, followed by an early surf the next morning. Thanks to Rober for the picture! They can also be found on [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/barbucias/).

Not bad spot for a nap! Looking back I was lucky to have great weather and surf conditions for as long as I did for the start of my trip. For that reason I think I will remember my time at this place for a long time.
