The good weather conditions at La Pared eventually came to an end, the wind shifted to the south, and an opportunity arised to surf the south coast of Fuerteventura: Las Salinas.

Las Salinas is located close to El Puertito and the lighthouse of [Punta Jandía](https://www.wildcanarias.com/puertito-punta-jandia-fuerteventura/), and is accessible through a 20km long and curvy dirt road from the town of Morro Jable.

There are several surf spots along the long dirt road. I drove a little bit back and forth to find the spot where I could camp and surf for a few days. This is what I ended up with.

My predictions of good surf on the coastline were accurate and there was plenty of waves. All the waves in the area break on a reef/rock bottom, shaping them perfectly.

There was a lot of people in the water in the afternoon. But it was pretty relaxed. When I got out there were only a few people left.

Down the beach was another break that looked really good.

The beautiful landscape alone is worth the long trip there.

Obligatory surf van line-up. When this place starts working like this, the locals of the south will be here.

**Playa de Garcey**

The following day the surf was smaller and I decided to leave in the afternoon heading north. After spending the night in La Pared once again, and seeing that the waves were no good there - I decided to give [Playa de Garcey](https://surfermap.com/item/guide-surf-spot-american-star/) a chance.

I had low hopes of surfing that day based on what I had seen elsewhere, but when I rolled down to the beach after another long dirt road I was smiling from ear to ear. The wind was hitting this particular beach perfectly, and the waves were super consistent and fun. Also there was only one guy out when I got there.

A group of Swiss joined in after a little while and we all had a lot fun surfing and cheering at each other until everyone were exhausted. The Swiss had spent a week there and said it was the best session they'd had. Awesome. Even after 3 months and countless surf sessions I rate this one very highly.

I stayed at the beach for next day, hoping for a repeat of the magic session - but it never materialized. Instead I got this great photo of what was my camping spot for a few days.
